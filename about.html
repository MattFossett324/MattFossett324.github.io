            <h2>My Education</h2>
            <p>
                I attended The University Of Oklahoma and achieved my B.S. in Computer Engineering, with a Minor in Computer Science in May 2023. In the future I may return and get my Masters of Business Administration.

            <h2>My Passions</h2>
            <p>
                
              During Covid in 2020, I picked up the game of golf and ever since I have been addicted. I have found it to be a great way to get outside and get a little bit of exercise and fresh air, as well as spending time with friends. 
                I enjoy building computers and have built quite a few by myself and with my peers. I started building computers early in high school, and I believe that is what nurtured my curiosity for STEM, leading me to do Engineering in college.
